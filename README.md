# Gender, Experience, and Compensation in Modern Workplaces: A Machine Learning Analysis of Salary Survey Data Using Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting

### Project OverView

This research aims to understand how various demographic and professional variables impact compensation in modern workplaces. The primary goal is to promote fairness, equity, and evidence-based decisions within the workplace by studying these relationships. The project utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and time-series (t-series) forecasting for its analysis.

### Data Sources

The research utilizes the **AskAManager.org salary survey dataset**. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to study compensation dynamics as it contains real-world, real-people salary data. The dataset is comprehensive, including both structured attributes such as age, gender, education, and salary, and unstructured attributes like free-form job titles, compensation context, and additional earnings. It covers a wide diversity of employee experience across multiple industries, countries, and demographic groups. Furthermore, the dataset is dynamic, allowing for the application of time series forecasting to simulate future compensation trends.

### Tools 
  - Excel (Data Cleaning)
  
  - Google Collab (Data Analysis and Visualisation)
    
  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  To ensure accuracy and avoid discrepancies, a rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing phase is undertaken, particularly for the structured and unstructured attributes within the dataset. This phase includes:
  
    - Text standardization of job titles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like spaCy and TF-IDF.
    
    - Currency normalization based on current and historical exchange rates.
    
    - Outlier detection and treatment using statistical methods such as z-scores and Interquartile Range methods.
    
    - Imputation of missing values using k-Nearest Neighbors or regression-based approaches.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

  The project's research objectives guide the exploratory data analysis and subsequent modeling, addressing core questions about compensation dynamics:
  
 - "How does gender, race, and age influence base salary and additional compensation when controlling experience, education, and job type?"
  
- "Which features mostly predict salary outcomes across different sectors and roles?"
  
-  "What predictive frameworks most effectively estimate salary using demographics and professional attributes?"
  
- "What is the distribution of annual salary by gender and education level?"
  
- "How is additional compensation distributed across experience levels, segmented by gender?"
